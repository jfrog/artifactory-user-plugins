Artifactory Authenticate Entitlements User Plugin
=======================================

This plugin authenticates entitlements

Testing
---------------------

Here are the steps to setup and test this plugin locally.

Requrements:
  1. Docker
  1. Python3
  1. curl
  1. [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/getcli/)
  1. IntelliJ (but any Java IDE or even JDB will work)

Setup
---------------------
1. Clone the repository and switch branches:

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:jfrog/artifactory-user-plugins.git
  ```

1. Create the ``lib`` directory:

  ```
  mkdir lib
  ```

  And download these libraries and put them in the ``lib`` directory just created:

  * [HTTPBuilder](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.codehaus.groovy.modules.http-builder/http-builder/0.7.2)
  * [Json-lib](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.sf.json-lib/json-lib/2.4)
  * [Xml-resolver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/xml-resolver/xml-resolver/1.2)

  The ``beforeDebug.sh`` script will put these libraries where they need to be in the Docker container.

1. Open a second terminal to the ``approveDeny`` folder and run a debuggable Artifactory Docker container:

  ```
  bash scripts/rundocker.sh
  ```

1. Docker must be setup to support insecure registries. Before running this
script, go to Docker Desktop | Preferences | Docker Engine
and add the line:

  ```
  "insecure-registries": ["host.docker.internal:8081"]
  ```

  so the file looks like this:

  ```
  {
   "experimental": false,
   "features": {
     "buildkit": true
   },
   "insecure-registries": ["host.docker.internal:8081"]
  }
  ```

1. Install the license file:

  ```
  bash scripts/setupdocker.sh <PATH_TO_LICENSE_FILE>
  ```

1. Setup IntelliJ:

  1. File | Open and browse to the **approveDeny** plugin directory.
  1. Run | Edit Configurations
    1. Add New Configurations
    1. Choose **Remote JVM Debug**
    1. Change the port to 5555
    1. Press OK
    1. In the before launch list, click the + to add
    1. Choose **Run External Tool**
    1. Name: Push Changes
      Program: bash
      Arguments: beforeDebug.sh
      Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$

1. Logs are very important when debugging and will provide valuable information.
The log files are located in the ``/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory``. The most useful
one for plugins is ``artifactory-service.log``. There are two ways to get the logs:

    1. Shell into the Docker container and look at the file:
      ```
      docker exec -it rt1 sh
      cat /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/log/artifactory-service.log
      ```

    1. Use VS Code and the Docker plugin, search for your container in the docker
    plugin and browse to ``/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/log/artifactory-service.log``.
    Right click on the file and choose **open**. It will be automatically refresh
    when you select the VS Code window.

The only way to trigger the plugin code is to call a REST API call.

1. Run the test IP verification and entitlements server:

    ```
    python3 unittest/testserver.py
    ```
    Make sure the test server is working:

      ```
      curl http://localhost:8888
      ```

    Use VS Code with the Microsoft Python plugin to debug ``testserver.py`` and
    verify the API is correct.

Debugging
---------------------

Setup Artifactory to test the **approveDeny** plugin:

1. Attach the debugger to the Artifactory process **^D**.
1. Set a breakpoint in the plugin code.
1. Run the script to attempt to download the docker image. It will also
clear the docker image from any previous runs to force a download:

    ```
    cd scripts/docker
    bash testdocker.sh
    ```

1. Debugging:
  ^D debug
  F8 step
  F7 step into
  F9 resume

  Because Artifactory is running within Tomcat and the plugin is running inside of
  Artifactory, once the function you are debugging is complete you must choose **resume**
  or the process will appear to hang.


Useful Commands
---------------------

Sometimes Artifactory becomes unresponsive:

  ```
  docker restart rt1
  docker container logs --follow rt1
  ```

Remove Artifactory docker container:

  ```
  docker rm --force rt1
  ```

Sometimes you have to go digging around the Artifactory docker container:

  ```
  docker exec -it --user root rt1 bash
  ```

  then type ``su`` and you'll have full control of the bash shell.

You may see the error:

  ```
  16:29:27,284 |-ERROR in ch.qos.logback.classic.joran.JoranConfigurator@4d9bb279 - Could not open [/opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml]. java.io.FileNotFoundException: /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml (Permission denied)
	at java.io.FileNotFoundException: /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml (Permission denied)
  ```

  This means the the file ``logback.xml`` does not have the correct ownership.
  To correct this, open up a terminal with the command above, then check with
  this command:

  ```
  ls -al /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml
  -rw-r-----    1 artifact artifact     15982 Feb 18 16:29 /opt/jfrog/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/logback.xml
  ```

  Look at ``setupdocker.sh`` for how to setup ownership.
